This is my project repo for ECE800
## Description
* This project is a review mainly in the object detection filed. Traditional approach includes region
selection, feature extraction and classifier. This paper introduces
object detection based on R-CNN and illustrates why and how the
R-CNN family evolved. It also covers Mask R-CNN, which has a
great performance on high-quality objects segmentation task.
