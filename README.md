# ECE800 - Object Detection Based on R-CNN
This is my project repo for ECE800

## Description
* This project is a review mainly in the object detection filed. Traditional approaches include region selection, feature extraction, and classifier. It introduces object detection based on R-CNN and illustrates why and how the R-CNN family evolved. It also covers Mask R-CNN, which has a great performance on high-quality objects segmentation task.
* In this repo, there are two ipynb files. Rcnn.ipynb is a simple R-CNN implementation. Its dataset is also included in this repo. Detectron2.ipynb is a conclusion of how to use the R-CNN models in detectron2. But you need to use COCO dataset or prepare the custom dataset by yourself.
